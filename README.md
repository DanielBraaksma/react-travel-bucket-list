# Built with React

I built this simple travel bucket list using React to practice working with React.

I enjoy React's composability and find it easy to work with components that have specific responsibilities.

## Props

The data is stored in the data.js file and imported to the App.js file to simulate external data coming in.

Since React can render arrays, I mapped over the data and sent the object as a prop to the Card component. When the mapping has completed it is inserted in { } and allows react to render all the cards to the dom.

## React is powerful
I am excited to start using the power of React to start building more applications. I am enjoying working in React and I think this is due to having a strong foundation in regular JavaScript.
